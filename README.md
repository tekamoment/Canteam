# Canteam
Transportation assistant and canteen locator for National University of Singapore (NUS) students. 

This app was worked on across 24 hours during &lt;hackfestsg/> last September 2016. This repository contains the mobile front-end component, separate from the web and backend components, which are hosted in separate repositories.

This app uses the Shuttle Bus and Canteen Crowd APIs provided by the NUS Living Lab for this event.

(As a result of this app being built for NUS students, this app will not work correctly if not within NUS itself. A web version that simulates being within the NUS campus is available [here](https://itfactory.sg/hackfestsg/).)
